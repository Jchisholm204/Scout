## Overview
The Simulation LiDAR task is responsible for processing incoming LiDAR data from the USB interface.
It serves as both a verification of the processing method and as a template for future LiDAR processing tasks.

The task is designed to process LiDAR data one USB packet at a time.
As packets arrive, the following sequence of actions is taken:
1. A Local Collision Vector is computed based on the LiDAR points in the packet
2. The local collision vector is stored in the local collision vector array
3. The local collision vector array is used to compute the global collision vector
4. The global collision vector is sent to the control task for obstacle avoidance

## Data Processing

### LiDAR Data Input
Whereas a real LiDAR processing task would handle receiving data from the actual LiDAR sensor, the simulation task reads simulated LiDAR data from the USB interface with the following code snippet.

```c
// Attempt to pull the latest packet from the incoming process queue
static struct udev_pkt_lidar ldrpkt = {0};
if (xQueueReceive(pHndl->usb.rx, &ldrpkt, 100) != pdTRUE) {
    // Input Queue Empty
    printf("Lidar Input Queue Empty\n");
    continue;
}
```

### Local Collision Vector Calculation
After receiving the LiDAR data, the task processes the packet independently to calculate the local collision vector.
This is performed by looping over all points in the packet, using its identifier information to calculate the effective angle for each point.

```c
float sum_x = 0.0f;
float sum_y = 0.0f;
float ground_sum = 0.0f;
float ceil_sum = 0.0f;
int valid_points = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < ldrpkt.hdr.len; i++) {
    float d = (float) ldrpkt.distances[i] / 4000.0f;
    if (d > 45.0f || d < 0.1f) {
        continue;
    }
    valid_points++;
    float angle = udev_lidar_angle(ldrpkt.hdr.sequence, i);
    float weight = 1.0f / d;
    float cos = cosf(angle);
    sum_x += weight * cos;
    if (cos < 0) {
        ground_sum += fabsf(d * cos);
    } else {
        ceil_sum += fabsf(d * cos);
    }
    sum_y += weight * sinf(angle);
}

// Dont bother processing packets with no points
if (valid_points == 0) {
    continue;
}
```

Note that the processing loop ignores out of range points, and LiDAR packets that do not contain any valid points.

### Recording Local Collision Vectors
After calculating the local collision vector, the task adds it into its global array.
This allows LiDAR packets to be received and processed out of order without reordering.

```c
// Add the new resultant sum depending on lidar orientation
if (ldrpkt.hdr.id == eLidarFront) {
    pHndl->sums_front[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].x = sum_x;
    pHndl->sums_front[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].y = sum_y;
    pHndl->sums_front[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].z = 0.0f;
    pHndl->sums_front[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].w = 0.0f;
}
if (ldrpkt.hdr.id == eLidarVertical) {
    pHndl->sums_vertical[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].x = 0.0f;
    pHndl->sums_vertical[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].y = sum_y;
    pHndl->sums_vertical[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].z = sum_x;
    pHndl->sums_vertical[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence].w = 0.0f;
    pHndl->ceil_sums[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence] = ceil_sum;
    pHndl->ground_sums[ldrpkt.hdr.sequence] = ground_sum;
}
```

### Global Collision Vector Calculation
Finally, the task loops over the local vector array, now containing the newly updated segment, and calculates the global collision vector.
This vector can then be sent to the control task for obstacle avoidance.

```c
// Calculate the collision vector
ctrl_state_t cs;
cs.cv.x = 0;
cs.cv.y = 0;
cs.cv.z = 0;
cs.cv.w = 0;
cs.ground_distance = 0;
cs.ceil_distance = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < UDEV_LIDAR_SEQ_MAX; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
        cs.cv.data[j] += pHndl->sums_vertical[i].data[j];
        cs.cv.data[j] += pHndl->sums_front[i].data[j];
    }
    cs.ground_distance += pHndl->ground_sums[i];
    cs.ceil_distance += pHndl->ceil_sums[i];
}

// Send CV to control task
xQueueOverwrite(pHndl->cvtx.hndl, &cs);
```
